Octus Bridge acts as a bridge between EVM-compatible networks and the everscale network, facilitating the seamless transfer of tokens and data across supported networks.

The architecture of Octus Bridge not only enables the relay of token transfer events but also allows for the bridging of various forms of data between source and destination chains.

# Custom Data Bridging

To implement custom cross-chain data bridging, it is necessary to develop, propose, and obtain acceptance through a vote by the Octus Bridge DAO for the Configuration and Event contracts.
