# Octus Bridge Integration Guide

Octus Bridge is a universal bridge capable of connecting all kinds of blockchain networks, including from one EVM network to another and any other kind of network.

Octus Bridge's architecture extends beyond token transfers, enabling the bridging of different types of data between the source and destination chains.

# Custom Data Bridging

To implement custom cross-chain data bridging, it is necessary to develop, propose, and obtain acceptance through a vote by the Octus Bridge DAO for the Configuration and Event contracts.
