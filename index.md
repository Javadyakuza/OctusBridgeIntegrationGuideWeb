# OctusBridge Integration Guide

Octus Bridge serves as a vital connection between EVM-compatible networks and the Everscale network. Its primary function is to facilitate the smooth transfer of tokens and data across supported networks.

The architecture of Octus Bridge goes beyond relaying token transfer events. It also enables the bridging of different types of data between source and destination chains.

# Custom Data Bridging

To implement custom cross-chain data bridging, it is necessary to develop, propose, and obtain acceptance through a vote by the Octus Bridge DAO for the Configuration and Event contracts.
