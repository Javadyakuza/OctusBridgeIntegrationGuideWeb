# Octus Bridge Integration Guide

Octus Bridge serves as a vital connection point between EVM-compatible networks and the Everscale network. Its primary function is to facilitate the smooth transfer of tokens and data across supported networks.

Octus Bridge's architecture extends beyond token transfers, enabling the bridging of different types of data between the source and destination chains.

# Custom Data Bridging

To implement custom cross-chain data bridging, it is necessary to develop, propose, and obtain acceptance through a vote by the Octus Bridge DAO for the Configuration and Event contracts.
