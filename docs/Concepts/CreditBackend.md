## Credit Backend

Credit backends are a set of backend scripts that, in addition to their other responsibilities, are responsible for deploying event contracts, manually equalizing balances between associated networks during a transaction and [releasing or minting](./Operations.md#operational-differences-between-alien-tokens-and-native-tokens-in-everscale) tokens on recipient network.
