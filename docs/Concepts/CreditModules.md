Credit modules are a set of backend scripts that, in addition to their other responsibilities, are responsible for deploying event contracts when the transfer direction is EVM -> Ever and calling the saveWithdraw function's when the transfer direction is Ever -> EVM which leads to asset releasing or minting.
