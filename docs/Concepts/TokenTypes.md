# Token Types

### Alien Tokens

Tokens that are not originally from Everscale are known as alien tokens. Examples include [WETH](../addresses.md#weth), [WBTC](../addresses.md#wbtc), [USDT](../addresses.md#usdt) and others.

### Native Tokens

Token that play a vital role in the ecosystem such as [WEVER](../addresses.md#wever), [BRIDGE](../addresses.md#bridge), and [QUBE](../addresses.md#qube) are known as native tokens. For example, BRIDGE incentive's relayers, QUBE is the FlatQube DEX token, and unwrapped version of WEVER serves as the Everscale gas token. Other tokens that are created on Everscale for the first time are not considered as native tokens.

### Evm Gas Tokens

The Evm native coins are called Evm gas tokens for simplification.
