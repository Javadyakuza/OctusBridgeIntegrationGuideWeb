# Token Types

### Alien Tokens

Tokens that are not originally from Everscale are known as Alien tokens. Examples include [DAI](../addresses.md#dai), [WBTC](../addresses.md#wbtc), [USDT](../addresses.md#usdt) and others.

### Native Tokens

Token that play a vital role in the ecosystem such as [WEVER](../addresses.md#wever), [BRIDGE](../addresses.md#bridge), and [QUBE](../addresses.md#qube) are known as Native tokens. For example, BRIDGE incentivizes relayers, QUBE is the FlatQube DEX token, and unwrapped version of WEVER serves as the Everscale gas token. Other tokens that are created on Everscale for the first time are not considered as Native tokens.

### EVM Gas Tokens

The Native coins on the EVM networks are commonly referred to as EVM gas tokens for the purpose of simplification. Examples of such tokens include **ETH**, **BNB** and **Matic** among others.
